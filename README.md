# Multiplatform Button App !

Button Game Show App is an application to determine who clicks the button first in a round. It is an imitation of a button from game shows in which one of the most important elements is a duel of players through faster reaction and answering in a given time. The application therefore allows several players to compete and information which of them clicked the button first. 

## Game presentation
After enabling the application, the user must select his profile. He can create it or choose from existing ones. After selecting a profile, the user can create a lobby or join an existing one. This is how it looks from the perspective of the lobby administrator.

The game replaces the buttons in the game show for players. When the user presses the button,  he receives information about the order in which he clicked on the button. This works similarly to the first-press systems in TV tournaments. Thanks to the game, friends can play mini game shows in a smaller group with high accuracy, without any doubts about who came first.

The app gives you the option to delete a lobby, exit a lobby, or kick a user out of a lobby. Ejecting looks like the following.
The perspective of the person kicked out.
